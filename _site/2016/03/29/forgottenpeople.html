    <p>Thousands of people, who have been living in dire poverty for years, “forgotten” by the authorities because they are missing from census data. An investigation conducted by Code4SA Data Journalism Academy, based on data acquired from several sources has revealed that there are 97 informal settlements that were never counted in the last census conducted in 2011. In these settlements live thousands of “forgotten” people. NOLOYISO MTEMBU, LAILAH RYKLIEF AND JULIA RENOUPREZ report:</p>

<p>As Bongani Gocina makes his way through the narrow walkway winding through the maze of shacks in the Nyakathisa informal settlement, children playing on the path have to step aside so he can pass.</p>

<p>A woman walks past with a basket full of laundry, on her way to one of a handful of communal taps in the settlement. The shacks are so tightly crammed that in some places she struggles to get through.</p>

<p>The approximately 200 homes that make up Nyakathisa are situated in Ward 108, on the edge of Extension 6 in Mfuleni, south of Cape Town. They are built on a strip of land across the road from streets of RDP houses with fences and neat gardens. Although Nyakathisa is home to hundreds of people, there are only six communal toilets in the settlement, which are kept locked by a small group of shack dwellers who use them. They were built in 2013 and are shared by 18 households, so the remaining residents have no access to toilets.
As Gocina emerges from the shacks onto an open, sandy area, a choking smell of human excrement fills the air; these dunes, where children play nearby, are the toilets that most residents are forced to use to relieve themselves.</p>

<p>“Look how we are forced to live”, says Gocina, who works in the construction industry. He has lived in the settlement with his wife and three children since 2007. Back then, Nyakathisa comprised of a handful of shacks, but it has kept on growing over the years as more and more families, desperate for somewhere to live, moved into the area. It is a place of desperation inhabited by ”forgotten” people who eke out their living on the margins of society.</p>

<p>Nyakathisa is one of 97 informal settlements that were never counted in the last census held in 2011, according to data acquired from several sources In these settlements live thousands of “forgotten” people.</p>

<p>A census is a tool that governments use to count their population and to assess what services they have access to. “For many people, the census may be the only time that the state reaches them and asks them a question,” according to Statistics South Africa.</p>

<p>The 2011 Census counted 216 informal settlements in and around Cape Town. But, comparing the Census data with data on toilet facilities collected by the City of Cape Town, Weekend Argus was able to identify the uncounted 97 settlements. In some cases these settlements are made up of shacks that have mushroomed on empty pieces of land between houses in built up areas. Additional satellite data from Geoterraimage highlighted the rapid growth of informal settlements around Cape Town, and helped identify 23 new ones that have sprung up between the Census in 2011 and 2013. The dozens of shacks that make up Nyakathisa are tightly packed on a strip of ground across the road from brick RDP houses, with neat, fenced in gardens and tarred roads running past them. The people in the houses say that their health is affected by the squalid and unhealthy living conditions of their neighbours. Fearful of the devastation that a fire could cause if it swept through their settlement, the shack dwellers have hooked up illegal electrical connections to the neighbouring RDP houses, paying a fee that is determined by the house owners.</p>

	<figcaption>Residents of Nyakathisa say they were not counted in the Statistics South Africa 2011 Census, and the first time they were counted was in 2015, by the municipality. These residents use sand dunes as their toilets as there are only six toilets in the settlement, and only 18 families have access to these. <strong>VIDEO: LAILAH RYKLIEF</strong></figcaption>

<p>“Until recently Nyakathisa had no water or toilets. They used our water, and our bills were very high,” says Thembakazi Banjwa, another Nyakathisa resident.</p>

<p>“They still do not have electricity, hence you see illegal connections. A lot of us lived there until some people, including myself, moved into these RDP houses in 2008,” she said.</p>

<p>Nyakathisa was meant to be a temporary settlement while the RDP houses were being built, and, as more houses were built, the settlement was meant to have ceased to exist, Banjwa said. For Gocina and many other residents, every year that has passed presented hope that their turn would come to move to better housing.</p>

<p>“There were about 30 shacks here when I came, but the settlement has grown since then. I do not remember anyone doing a census here in 2011,” he said. It was only when the Weekend Argus visited the settlement that Gocina learnt that his settlement was not counted in the Census in 2011. He was shocked.
“This is painful because we have been hopeful that we are being considered, especially for houses and electricity. It seems no one even knows we exist, yet we have been voting,” he said, shaking his head.
Like many other Nyakathisa residents, Gocina said they seldom saw the area’s ward councillor, Themba Honono of the ANC.
“We sometimes hear that he is visiting Bardale or other sections but we have never met him here,” the resident said. Honono failed to respond to a request for comment.
Statistics South Africa spokesman Trevor Oosterwyk denied that some informal settlements were not included in the 2011 count.</p>

<p>“The City of Cape Town is 100 percent covered with enumeration areas (EAs). Unless an EA was not enumerated, all people were enumerated,” Oosterwyk said. Asked about Cape Town settlements which were not reflected in the Census, he said: ““The fact that we do not have these names as sub-places does not mean the areas were not enumerated. No omissions were made.” Cape Town mayoral committee member for human settlements, Benedicta van Minnen did not deal with questions about informal settlements not being counted. She said the city conducted its own surveys in informal settlements “to ensure that our records are kept updated and that we have a specific understanding of the dynamics within informal settlements pertaining to the growth of the population, service levels and future service requirements”.</p>

<p>But he admitted that some people could have been left out because they were not in their homes when the enumerators visited their areas.
“People who work in places far away from home and, thus leave very early in the morning and return late in the evening were difficult to enumerate. Enumerators only worked between 8am and 7pm and there would be people who leave their homes at 5am and return after 8pm for instance. In most cases this was mitigated by making suitable appointments with people to be counted,” he said. But Gocina and others insist, there were no enumerators in Nyakathisa in 2011.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-did-it">How we did it</h2>

<p><strong>March - August 2015</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://nu.org.za/" target="_blank">Ndifuna Ukwazi (NU)</a>, a Cape Town-based civic activist organisation and law clinic, made numerous requests to the City of Cape Town for data concerning water and sanitation in informal settlements in Cape Town. After submitting a PAIA (Promotion of Access to Information Act) request to the City of Cape Town requesting the information, the City supplied NU with a number of scanned documents containing the type and GPS location of public toilet facilities in informal settlements in and around Cape Town.</p>

<p><strong>September - October 2015</strong></p>

<p>Code for South Africa gained access to these documents from NU and converted the documents to compile a single database of all the public toilet locations in Cape Town’s informal settlements. Geographic data analyst at Code for South Africa, Julia Renouprez mapped the location of the toilets. With knowledge of the toilet’s locations, Renouprez was able to identify the boundaries of informal settlements where the toilets were located. These boundaries did not match the boundaries shown in the 2011 Census data. In other words, the City of Cape Town had provided toilets to areas that did not exist in the census data. The question, then, was: did these settlements exist at the time of the 2011 Census and simply weren’t counted? Or are they new settlements that have mushroomed since the survey was conducted?</p>

<p><strong>March 2015</strong></p>

<p>A geolocation information services company, <a href="http://www.geoterraimage.com/" target="_blank">Geoterraimage</a>, provided a dataset which maps human settlements, using satellite imagery taken in 2013. From this data, Code for South Africa was able to identify the settlements which existed before 2011, and those which existed after 2013. This analysis showed 97 settlements that were not counted in 2011, and 23 which appeared to have developed after 2013.</p>
